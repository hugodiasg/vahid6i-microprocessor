# vahid6i-microprocessor
16 bits and 6 instructions microprocessor in VHDL with Quartus II, FPGA Cyclone IV - DE0-Nano kit and TimeQuest.

* The microprocessor was used, as an example, to add the values of a vector of 8 elements stored in memory and store the result of the sum in another memory address. The vector was (5, 7, 8, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3) and the result of the sum was 39.
